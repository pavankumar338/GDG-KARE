## How to Access

The page is now available at: **`/ml-event`**

You can navigate to it by:
1. Going directly to `http://localhost:5174/ml-event`
2. Adding a link in your navigation or events page
3. Adding a "Register" button in your events section

## Example Usage in Other Components

To link to the ML Event registration from other pages:

```jsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

// In your Events component or anywhere else:
<Link to="/ml-event">
  <button>Register for ML Event</button>
</Link>
```

## Form Data Structure

When submitted, the form collects:
```javascript
{
  name: "Student Name",
  regno: "99230304050", 
  whatsapp: "9876543210",
  year: "2nd Year",
  email: "99230304050@klu.ac.in"
}
```

The form is now fully functional and ready for integration with your backend API. You can modify the submission logic in the `handleSubmit` function to send data to your actual registration endpoint.

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect the form to your registration API
2. **Email Verification**: Add email verification if needed
3. **Event Details**: Update the event information section with actual details
4. **Navigation**: Add links to this page from your main events section

The page follows all your existing design patterns and should integrate seamlessly with your current GDG KARE website!
